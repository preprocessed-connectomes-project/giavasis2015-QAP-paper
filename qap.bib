   Abstract={The ability to analyze and merge data across sites, vendors, and field strengths depends on one's ability to acquire images with the same image quality including image smoothness, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). SNR can be used to compare different magnetic resonance scanners as a measure of comparability between the systems. This study looks at the SNR and CNR ratios in structural fast spin-echo T2-weighted scans acquired in five individuals across ten sites that are part of Functional Imaging Research of Schizophrenia Testbed Biomedical Informatics Research Network (fBIRN). Different manufacturers, field strengths, gradient coils, and RF coils were used at these sites. The SNR of gray matter was fairly uniform (41.3-43.3) across scanners at 1.5 T. The higher field scanners produced images with significantly higher SNR values (44.5-108.7 at 3 T and 50.8 at 4 T). Similar results were obtained for CNR measurements between gray/white matter at 1.5 T (9.5-10.2), again increasing at higher fields (10.1-28.9 at 3 T and 10.9 at 4 T).},

   Abstract={We present the use of an entropy focus criterion to enable automatic focusing of motion corrupted magnetic resonance images. We demonstrate the principle using illustrative examples from cooperative volunteers. Our technique can determine unknown patient motion or use knowledge of motion from other measures as a starting estimate. The motion estimate is used to compensate the acquired data and is iteratively refined using the image entropy. Entropy focuses the whole image principally by favoring the removal of motion induced ghosts and blurring from otherwise dark regions of the image. Using only the image data, and no special hardware or pulse sequences, we demonstrate correction for arbitrary rigid-body translational motion in the imaging plane and for a single rotation. Extension to three-dimensional (3-D) and more general motion should be possible. The algorithm is able to determine volunteer motion well. The mean absolute deviation between algorithm and navigator-echo-determined motion is comparable to the displacement step size used in the algorithm. Local deviations from the recorded motion or navigator-determined motion are explained and we indicate how enhanced focus criteria may be derived. In all cases we were able to compensate images for patient motion, reducing blurring and ghosting.},

   Abstract={In the present report, estimates of test-retest and between-site reliability of fMRI assessments were produced in the context of a multicenter fMRI reliability study (FBIRN Phase 1, www.nbirn.net). Five subjects were scanned on 10 MRI scanners on two occasions. The fMRI task was a simple block design sensorimotor task. The impulse response functions to the stimulation block were derived using an FIR-deconvolution analysis with FMRISTAT. Six functionally-derived ROIs covering the visual, auditory and motor cortices, created from a prior analysis, were used. Two dependent variables were compared: percent signal change and contrast-to-noise-ratio. Reliability was assessed with intraclass correlation coefficients derived from a variance components analysis. Test-retest reliability was high, but initially, between-site reliability was low, indicating a strong contribution from site and site-by-subject variance. However, a number of factors that can markedly improve between-site reliability were uncovered, including increasing the size of the ROIs, adjusting for smoothness differences, and inclusion of additional runs. By employing multiple steps, between-site reliability for 3T scanners was increased by 123%. Dropping one site at a time and assessing reliability can be a useful method of assessing the sensitivity of the results to particular sites. These findings should provide guidance toothers on the best practices for future multicenter studies.},
